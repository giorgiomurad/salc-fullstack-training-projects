      The Job Seek website started off as a graduation project by Giorgio Murad in 2024, and was soon taken advantage by a number of non-employers who are
      looking for jobs around the country.
      <br>
      The web application was later introduced and published live, and gained significant popularity in Lebanon, and being labeled as one of the top Lebanese
      employment site until the web-application was fully globalised.
